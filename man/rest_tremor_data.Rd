\title{Device-Motion data from a performed resting tremor assay}
\format{A 3002 x 6 data frame with column names \code{attitude},
\code{timestamp}, \code{rotationRate}, \code{userAcceleration},
\code{gravity}, and \code{magneticField}. The column names correspond
to the measurements returned by a
[CMDeviceMotion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmdevicemotion)
object as described in Apple's developer documentation. \code{rotationRate},
\code{userAcceleration},\code{gravity} are each 3002 x 3 data frames with column names
\code{x}, \code{y}, \code{z} containing axial measurements for their respective sensor.
\code{magneticField} has an additional column \code{accuracy} specifying
the calibration accuracy of the magnetic field estimate. \code{attitude}
columns are quaternion coefficients.}
\usage{
rest_tremor_data
}
\description{
The resting tremor assay entails participants holding the mobile device
in their hand (either right or left) while resting that hand in their lap
for approximately 10 seconds.
